# Chemistry3D

> Welcome to Chemistry3Dâ€™s documentation!

Chemistry3D is an advanced chemistry simulation laboratory leveraging the capabilities of IsaacSim. This platform offers a comprehensive suite of both organic and inorganic chemical experiments, which can be conducted in a simulated environment. One of the distinguishing features of Chemistry3D is its ability to facilitate robotic operations within these experiments. The primary objective of this simulation environment is to provide a robust and reliable testing ground for both experimental procedures and the application of robotics within chemical laboratory settings.

The development of this system aims to integrate chemical experiment simulation with robotic simulation environments, thereby enabling the visualization of chemical experiments while facilitating the simulation of realistic robotic operations. This environment supports the advancement of embodied intelligence for robots, the execution of reinforcement learning tasks, and other robotic operations. Through this integrated environment, we aspire to seamlessly combine chemical experiment simulation with robotic simulation, ultimately creating a comprehensive test environment for the entire chemical experimentation process.

## What can we do in Chemistry3D?
* **The HR remote sensing images** with 0.25-meter and 0.5-meter resolution were collected from the LandCover.ai dataset where the image sources are from the public geodetic resource used in the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS). The images contained three bands of red, green, and blue.

* **The rough historical labeled data** with 10-meter resolution were collected from three types of global land-cover products which were (1) The FROM_GLC10 provided by the Tsinghua University, (2) The ESA_WorldCover v100 provided by the European Space Agency (ESA), and (3) The ESRI 10-meter global land cover (abbreviated as ESRI_GLC10) provided by the ESRI Inc. and IO Inc. The 30-meter resolution labeled data were collected from the 30-meter global land-cover product GLC_FCS30 provided by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).

* **The HR ground references** were obtained from the OpenEarthMap dataset provided by the University of Tokyo. The ground references were interpreted based on the 0.25-meter and 0.5-meter resolution LPIS imagery and contained five land-cover types.
