# Chemistry3D

> Welcome to Chemistry3Dâ€™s documentation!

Chemistry3D is an advanced chemistry simulation laboratory leveraging the capabilities of IsaacSim. This platform offers a comprehensive suite of both organic and inorganic chemical experiments, which can be conducted in a simulated environment. One of the distinguishing features of Chemistry3D is its ability to facilitate robotic operations within these experiments. The primary objective of this simulation environment is to provide a robust and reliable testing ground for both experimental procedures and the application of robotics within chemical laboratory settings.

The development of this system aims to integrate chemical experiment simulation with robotic simulation environments, thereby enabling the visualization of chemical experiments while facilitating the simulation of realistic robotic operations. This environment supports the advancement of embodied intelligence for robots, the execution of reinforcement learning tasks, and other robotic operations. Through this integrated environment, we aspire to seamlessly combine chemical experiment simulation with robotic simulation, ultimately creating a comprehensive test environment for the entire chemical experimentation process.

## What can we do in Chemistry3D?
* **Multiple chemical reaction simulation** Chemistry can simulate a range of organic and inorganic reactions.

* **Robotic manipulaitions** In the context of Chemistry3D, we have introduced a modularized approach to the development of motion controllers for frequently encountered chemical experiment operations. Specifically, we have encapsulated the core functionalities of these controllers into distinct modules, thereby enhancing their reusability and maintainability. To effectively oversee these modules, we have implemented a Controller Manager class, which not only manages the existing controllers but also facilitates the seamless integration of individual modules. Furthermore, we recognize the need for flexibility and customization in chemical experimentation. Therefore, we have designed the Controller Manager to support user-defined controllers, enabling researchers to create new controllers tailored to their specific experimental requirements. The Controller Manager is capable of dynamically incorporating these new controllers into the overall framework, thus ensuring a comprehensive and adaptive motion control system for chemical experiments in Chemistry3D

* **Visual sim2real** The implementation of robotic manipulation driven by visual inputs holds significant potential across various application domains. Chemistry3D based on Isaac Sim, leverages the state-of-the-art light simulation capabilities. Our focus lies in transparent chemical containers, which are ubiquitous in chemical experimentation. These containers pose unique challenges due to their transparency, often leading to issues such as optical distortions and reflections. To address these challenges, we have realized sim2real transfer for transparent objects within the Chemistry3D framework. This approach enables us to leverage the simulated environment for training and testing, while ensuring the effectiveness of the trained models in real-world scenarios. To this end, we have integrated segmentation_models.pytorch, a powerful library for semantic segmentation, into our platform. This integration has facilitated the development of a benchmark for visual training, tailored specifically for transparent chemical containers. Experimental results demonstrate that Chemistry3D is capable of implementing sim2real transfer for light-simulated objects, even in complex and challenging scenarios. The platform's open nature allows for the testing of various algorithms, making it a valuable tool for researchers seeking to develop and evaluate robotic manipulation techniques based on visual inputs.
