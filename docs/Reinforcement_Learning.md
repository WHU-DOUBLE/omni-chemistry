Chemical experimental manipulations are often continuous processes, making RL an essential tool for integrating chemistry experiments with robotic simulation. IsaacGym is a well-regarded simulation environment specifically designed to support robot learning. The Omniverse Isaac Gym Reinforcement Learning (OmniIsaacGymEnvs) for Isaac Sim repository provides RL examples compatible with IsaacSim and has become a widely adopted environment for RL research. 

To run RL tasks in Chemistry3Dï¼Œyou could install OmniIsaacGymEnvs first. Please refer to [OmniIsaacGymEnvs](https://github.com/isaac-sim/OmniIsaacGymEnvs).

If you want to run our RL example, please copy our files in **Reinforcement_Learning** to corresponding place in **OmniIsaacGymEnvs**.
